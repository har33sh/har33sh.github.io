My name is Hareesh Kumar. I'm currently working as a Data Scientist researcher at Centre of Excellence - AI/ML,  Reliance Jio. I work on identifying, formulating, and providing solutions to problems in Healthcare, Agriculture, and Retail Domain.

Before Jio, I was working in the [Smart Energy Informatics Lab at CSE](http://seil.cse.iitb.ac.in/), IIT Bombay as a Research Assitant under the advisory of [Prof. Krithi Ramamritham](https://sites.google.com/site/ramamrithamkrithi/home/). Most of our work dealt with a computational perspective to smart energy management, with an emphasis on smart buildings and smart electric grids. Besides computational thinking, we use data-driven approaches, and techniques such as inferencing and learning, focusing specifically on improving energy efficiency.
