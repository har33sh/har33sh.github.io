I am currently working in the Smart Energy Informatics Lab at CSE, IIT Bombay as a Research Assitant under the advisory of Dr. Krithi Ramamritham. Our work deals with computational perspective to smart energy management, with an emphasis on smart buildings and smart electric grids. Besides computational thinking, we use data driven approaches, and techniques such as inferencing and learning, focusing specifically on improving energy efficiency.
