# What is DeepLearning ?
DeepLearning has transformed traditional internet business like websearch and advertising. DeepLearning has also helped people in improving their lives, everthing ranging from [health care](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05718.pdf) to [pesonalised education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbrTkUE4YHs) to self-driving cars. Over the next few decates DeepLearning is going to transform every major industry.

Term DeepLearning generally refers to training **Neural Networks**(NN), so what exactly is a NN ? Lets say we want to predict Housing *Price*, given the *size* of house. Since there is only one variable involved we could say that Price = x * size +y. The value of *y* could be negative but the price cannot be negative, Price = max(0,x*size+y)

(size) -> (Neuron) -> price

In general, a neuron takes a input (x), applies some mathematical tranformations on it and produces a output (y)

  x    -> (Neuron) ->  y

A larger Neural Network is fomed by adding more Neruons to the network. What if there is more data available with us ? Let us add more data to the above.

x1    -#-> (Neuron) -#-^  

x2    -#-> (Neuron) -#->  -#-> (Neuron) -#-^

x3    -#-> (Neuron) -#->  -#-> (Neuron) -#->  (prediction)

x4    -#-> (Neuron) -#->  -#-> (Neuron) -#-^

x4    -#-> (Neuron) -#-^

Neural Networks could be considered as a black box, given x and y, the other details would be calculated automatically. Given enough data (training examples x,y) to the Nerual Network are very good at predicting.



# Supervised Learning vs Unsupervised Learning ?
*Supervised Learning* : Learning from labelled data(Input(X) and Output(Y) are specified)
*Unsupervised Learning* : Learning from unlabelled data

Most of the hypes on the DeepLearning/Neural Network on the Supervised Learning.
## Some fancy names and where they are used
Standard Neural Networks : House Pricing, Advertisement clicking
[Convolutional Neural Networks](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/) : Images, Question Answering systems.
[Recurrent Neural Networks](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/) : Audio, Languague (1D temporal Sequence)
Hybrid Neural Networks : Combinations of above


## Structued Data vs Unstructured Data ?
*Structued Data* : Organized data (Eg: Database data). Computers can understand the data better.
*Unstructued Data* : Eg: Audio, Images, Text. Humans generally can understand the data better.


# Why sudden popularity?

The accuracy if the Nerual Network model, depe
- Size of the Dataset
- Size of the Neural Network
- Algorithms used in the Neural Network

**Data** : Activites on the digital devices has made more data possible than ever. Eg: Mobile Cameras to collect image data. [A full 90% of all the data in the world has been generated over the last two years](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130522085217.htm)

Performance of the Standard Machine Learning models doesnt necessarly improve with increase in data, but the Performance of the Neural Networks increases when there is more data.


**Computation** : Bigger Neural Networks need lot of time for training (some NN may take secs to train, some might even take days !). GPU's have made the computations faster. [NVIDIA GPU computing has given the industry a path forward â€” and will provide a 1,000X speed-up by 2025](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about-nvidia/ai-computing/)


**Algorithms** : Innovation of new algorithms from the DeepLearning community. For eg: [Dropping neurons at random during the training can improve accuracy](https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-dropout-method-work-in-deep-learning-And-why-is-it-claimed-to-be-an-effective-trick-to-improve-your-network)



If your Neural Network is having performing good ?
- Throw more data at it
- Increase the size of the network
- Try different Algorithm

In most of the cases above would increase the performance of your Neural Network
